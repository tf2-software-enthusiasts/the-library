# SDKs for popular TF2 APIs

A collection of highly curated packages for multiple languages to help consolidate different TF2-focused APIs into a set of highly predictable and useful API interfaces to consume.

# Goals

We wish to provide highly consumable packages for developers to consume, without worrying much about how individual APIs are queried in multiple languages. Alongside this, we want to provide a somewhat rigid set of consistent conventions between the APIs to help consume them easier, whether you're dealing with snake_case in one api to PascalCase in others, we want to help bridge that gap to make it easier for you to develop.

# Strategy

The repoistory is set up as a lot of monorepos. There's different folders for each language, such as the `javascript-sdk` which is a monorepo of TypeScript libraries and packages that can be used to create and maintain both the types for these APIs and also the SDK for those APIs.

# Contributing

If you wish to contribute, please make sure to read our [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING) guidelines. There's a goal to have consistent design between languages and it will benefit if you could continue to follow those guidelines. Each language may have a set of their own standards to align to that specific language's syntax.
